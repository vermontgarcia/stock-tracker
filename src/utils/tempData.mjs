    summary:
      'The US Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell has developed a reputation for dragging its feet on implementing important policy changes. However, a top central banker has assured that the Fed is “absolutely” ready to do whatever it takes to avoid a financial crisis, whether triggered by the US-led trade war or other adverse developments.Although the long-awaited “Fed pivot” could still be months away, policymakers appear poised to gradually ease financial conditions, beginning last month when they reduced the redemption cap on Treasurys by 80%. Fed policy exerts a gravitational pull on global markets through US dollar liquidity, which has a direct impact on Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency markets. In fact, the Fed’s impact on crypto has only grown since the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with liquidity — a fact that was reinforced by a 2024 academic paper by Kingston University of London. This week’s Crypto Biz newsletter highlights remarks from a senior central bank official and covers major developments in the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) market and the Bitcoin mining sector.Fed’s Collins: Central bank will respond to liquidity constraints Boston Fed President Susan Collins said the central bank “would absolutely be prepared” to backstop markets if economic and financial conditions deteriorated rapidly. Collins was specifically referring to potential liquidity issues or other disruptions that could hinder normal market functioning.Currently, however, Collins noted that the central bank is “not seeing liquidity concerns.” Should that outlook shift, she emphasized that the Fed has “tools to address concerns about markets functioning or liquidity.”Collins is a voting member of this year’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is responsible for setting interest rates. Investors expect the FOMC to refrain from cutting interest rates at its forthcoming meeting in May, based on Fed Fund Futures prices. However, the likelihood of a June rate cut has risen to 67.5%.

The options trading approval is also seen as an important step in the SEC’s deliberations around staking services on ETH ETFs. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SEC may be on track to approve staking as early as May.Source: James SeyffartSolana staking ETFs come to CanadaAs the US SEC continues to deliberate about crypto staking services, Canadian regulators have approved another suite of crypto staking ETFs, this time for Solana (SOL).This week, asset managers 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve, and CI received approvals from the Ontario Securities Commission to offer staked Solana ETFs. The 3iQ fund selected blockchain infrastructure provider Figment as its primary staking provider. According to 3iQ’s website, its Solana Staking ETF will offer yields of between 6% and 8%.The Toronto-based 3iQ launched a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in 2021, some three years before similar funds were approved in the United States.Bitdeer reportedly pivots to self-mining as trade war rattles supply chainBitcoin mining company Bitdeer is expanding its self-mining capacity and pouring more resources into the United States amid fears that the US-led trade war will rattle global supply chains and upend its hardware business. According to an April 15 report by Bloomberg, Bitdeer is prioritizing BTC mining due to declining demand for its mining rigs.As the broader industry grapples with the potential impact of tariffs, “Our plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,” Bitdeer executive Jeff LaBerge told Bloomberg. On the topic of US expansion, LaBerge said, “This is something we’ve been planning for a long time.” US President Donald Trump’s sons, Eric and Don Jr, are going all-in on Bitcoin mining after backing a new venture with Hut 8. This follows a renewed commitment by the Trump administration to promote “made in America” Bitcoin.Crypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.',

      "TRUMP tokenholders face steep losses as the first vesting unlock goes live on April 18, releasing 40 million tokens, worth roughly $309 million, into circulation at a 90% discount from its peak. The unlocked tokens account for 20% of the current circulating supply and could introduce fresh volatility as a previously illiquid portion of the supply hits the market. According to CoinGecko, the TRUMP token price has fluctuated between $7.46 and $7.83 in the past 24 hours.  April 18 marks the first unlock event for the TRUMP token, with steady, smaller unlocks following from that date.TRUMP emission schedule.

The token's value collapsed in the weeks following its debut, with over 800,000 wallets suffering a total of $2 billion in losses, according to estimates from blockchain analytics firm ChainalysisGains or losses are only realized upon sale, meaning holders won’t incur actual losses unless they choose to sell their tokens.

    summary:
      "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range for a few days, but a minor positive is that the bulls have kept the price above $83,000. Usually, a low volatility period is followed by a range expansion, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty.Cryptocurrency analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects because gold’s rally in 2017 and 2020 was followed by a sharp rise in Bitcoin's price. Theya head of growth Joe Consorti said in a post on X that Bitcoin follows gold with a lag of roughly 100 to 150 days. If Bitcoin moves as per Consorti’s expectations, a new all-time high could be hit between Q3 and Q4 of 2025. On similar lines, trading and analytics account Cryptollica projected a medium-term target of $155,000 for Bitcoin.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also bullish on altcoins. Swiss bank Sygnum said in its Q2 2025 investment outlook that improved regulations for crypto use cases have prepared the ground for a strong altcoins rally in the second quarter, as “none of the positive developments have been priced in.”Could Bitcoin and the altcoins break above their respective overhead resistance levels and start a recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin has been trading between the 20-day exponential moving average ($83,463) and the 200-day simple moving average ($87,857), indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the 20-day EMA cracks, the selling could pick up, and the BTC/USDT pair may slide to $78,500 and then to $73,777. Buyers are expected to defend the $73,777 level with all their might because a break below it may signal the start of a downtrend.On the contrary, a break and close above the 200-day SMA indicates that the corrective phase may be over. The pair could climb to $95,000 and eventually to the psychologically critical level of $100,000.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) has been trading between the $1,368 support and the $1,754 resistance, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a slight edge to the sellers. If the price slips below $1,471, the ETH/USDT pair could descend to $1,368. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $1,368 support because a break below it may sink the pair to $1,150.On the upside, the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1,676) and $1,754. A break and close above the resistance zone could propel the pair to the breakdown level of $2,111.XRP price analysisThe bears have failed to sink XRP (XRP) below the $2 support, suggesting a lack of selling pressure at lower levels.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to start a recovery, which could reach the 50-day SMA ($2.23). This is an essential short-term level to keep an eye on because a break above it opens the doors for a rally to the resistance line. Buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line to signal a short-term trend change.Alternatively, a break below the $2 support tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The XRP/USDT pair could then plunge to the $1.72 to $1.61 support zone.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) has been trading just below the downtrend line, indicating that the bulls have held on to their positions as they anticipate a breakout.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $644. Sellers will try to defend the $644 resistance, but the bulls are expected to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($588). If that happens, the likelihood of a rally to $680 increases.This optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $566. That could keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for some more time.Solana price analysisSolana (SOL) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($126) on April 16 and rose above the 50-day SMA ($130), indicating buying on dips.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe SOL/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $153, where the bears are expected to mount a stiff resistance. If buyers pierce the $153 level, the pair could surge toward $180.Buyers are expected to guard the zone between the 20-day EMA and $120. If the zone gives way, it suggests that the bears are active at higher levels. The pair could then descend to the $110 support.Dogecoin price analysisDogecoin (DOGE) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.16) and the crucial support at $0.14 for the past few days.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattening 20-day EMA and the positive divergence on the RSI suggest reduced selling pressure. Buyers will have to drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.17) to gain the upper hand. The DOGE/USDT pair could climb to $0.20, an essential level to watch out for as a break above it completes a double bottom pattern.Contrarily, a break and close below the $0.14 support signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend. The pair could then plummet to $0.10.Cardano price analysisBuyers have kept Cardano (ADA) above the $0.59 support but are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.63).ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price turns down and breaks below $0.59, the ADA/USDT pair could slide toward the solid support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it signals the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $0.40.Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the 50-day SMA ($0.70). The pair could then rally to $0.83.Related: Bitcoin price volatility 'imminent' as speculators move 170K BTC — CryptoQuantUNUS SED LEO price analysisUNUS SED LEO’s (LEO) failure to rise above the uptrend line may have tempted short-term buyers to book profits.LEO/USD daily chart.

Buyers will have to overcome this barrier to start a new up move.On the downside, a break and close below $17.50 may sink the AVAX/USDT pair to $15.27.

    summary:
      'Federal prosecutors said they will continue pursuing their case against Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon, despite the US Justice Department issuing a memo suggesting a policy of abandoning “regulation by prosecution” related to digital assets.In an April 18 filing in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, US Attorney for EDNY John Durham said his office had reviewed the April 7 DOJ memo issued by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and intended to proceed with a trial against Karony. The former SafeMoon CEO faces securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy charges for allegedly “divert[ing] and misappropriat[ing] millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token between 2021 and 2022.April 18 notice that US prosecutors will continue to prosecute John Karony. Source: PACERKarony, initially indicted in October 2023 under former US Attorney for EDNY Breon Peace, argued in February that his criminal trial should be delayed, hinting that securities laws enforcement under the Donald Trump presidency could see “significant changes.” The judge denied the motion and later ordered jury selection for the trial to begin on May 5. However, Karony’s legal team made its claims about securities laws under Trump potentially undergoing “policy changes” before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed cases and dropped investigations into many crypto firms facing allegations of violating securities laws. Blanche’s April 7 memo also suggested that the DOJ under Trump would direct jurisdictions not to pursue many crypto enforcement cases.Related: Democrats slam DOJ’s ‘grave mistake’ in disbanding crypto crime unit“[T]he parties may learn within days or hours of the commencement of trial that DOJ no longer considers digital assets like SafeMoon to be ‘securities’ under the securities laws,” said Karony’s legal team on Feb. 5. “Worse, the parties may learn this during or shortly after a trial, half of whose charges rest on the government’s claim that SafeMoon is such a security.”Crypto enforcement by the SEC and DOJ under TrumpSince being appointed acting SEC chair by Trump in January, Mark Uyeda has led the agency to drop cases against Ripple Labs, Coinbase, Kraken, and others. The SEC has also launched a crypto task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce to explore a regulatory framework for digital assets, and issued a memo saying memecoins were not securities. The agency’s actions suggest a more permissive approach to digital assets than that under former chair Gary Gensler.“By directing the SEC to abdicate its critical mission of investor protection, Mr. Trump is unnecessarily endangering our financial system,” said former SEC official John Reed Stark in an April 18 New York Times op-ed with Duke University lecturing fellow Lee Reiners. “Whether he is doing so to keep his promise to crypto-donors or in a zeal to cash in (or perhaps even both), that is a troubling development not just for investors and banks, but for all of us.”Whether Trump’s appointees in the Justice Department intend to step in and move to halt Karony’s case, as the DOJ did in the corruption case with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, is unclear. At the time of publication, the former SafeMoon CEO was set to go to trial in May and has been free on a $3 million bond since February 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.Magazine: SEC’s U-turn on crypto leaves key questions unanswered',

      "Bitcoin’s spot price could take a hit after the US Federal Reserve reported some of the worst manufacturing data in recent history, according to several cryptocurrency analysts.On April 17, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index — a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers — reported the sharpest declines in overall business activity since 2020. The data puts Bitcoin (BTC) “under short term pressure,” researchers at Bitunix, a crypto exchange, said in a post on the X platform.

As of April 18, Bitcoin has been trading at approximately $84,000 per coin, according to data from Google Finance.

Since Trump announced his tariff plans on April 2, Bitcoin has traded roughly flat after initially declining but more than 10%, Google Finance data shows. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 — an index of US stocks — is still down by around 7%. “Even in the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said. Trump initially sought to impose double-digit levies on virtually all foreign goods but later paused planned tariffs on certain countries. He still wants to place high taxes on many Chinese imports, causing concerns among crypto executives who fear a trade war could harm blockchain networks.

This signals a growing preference for self-custody or long-term investment.Bitcoin yearly absorption rates.

The result is less BTC supply on crypto exchanges and long-term bullish conviction among big holders.Most cohorts are buying the BTC price dipBitcoin whales holding over 10,000 BTC remain in strong accumulation territory, with their Trend Accumulation Score at around 0.7 as of April 18, according to Glassnode.Bitcoin trend accumulation score by cohort.

The score implies confidence among the largest holders of Bitcoin.In contrast, the sell-off in smaller cohorts that have been distributing earlier in the year appears to be slowing down. That includes the 10–100 BTC and the 1-100 BTC groups, whose scores have climbed back to a neutral zone at around 0.5.Even the smallest cohort (<1 BTC), largely composed of retail participants, is no longer in deep distribution mode, indicating a broader pivot back toward accumulation among most Bitcoin groups.Onchain analyst Mignolet adds that the whale behavior is similar to what preceded Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run.Bitcoin falling wedge breakout hints at $100KBitcoin has broken out of a multimonth falling wedge pattern, signaling a potential bullish reversal that could drive its price toward the $100,000 mark by May.A falling wedge forms when price action contracts between two downward-sloping trendlines and resolves with an upside breakout.

A bearish rejection from these EMAs risks pushing BTC’s price toward the wedge’s upper trendline near $80,000. “The 200-day moving average remains overhead as resistance, and the horizontal level at $88,804 is still the key barrier to flip market structure and print a higher high,” wrote market analyst Scott Melker, adding: “Encouraging – but not convincing – yet.

      'South Korea kicked off 2025 with political chaos, regulatory heat and a crypto market finally brought to heel — or at least forced to grow up.The nation closed 2024 in disarray following then-President Yoon Suk Yeol’s botched martial law stunt in December.In the aftermath, authorities spent the first quarter drawing lines in the sand as financial watchdogs slapped cryptocurrency exchanges with probes and lifted the ban on corporate trading accounts. Meanwhile, crypto adoption hit record highs as trading volume cooled.Here’s a breakdown of the key developments that shaped South Korea’s crypto sector in Q1 of 2025.South Korea’s economy limped into 2025 as local currency tanked. Source: Ki Young JuSouth Korean crypto traders given yet another two-year tax exemptionJan. 1 — Crypto tax postponedA planned 20% capital gains tax on crypto did not take effect on Jan. 1 after lawmakers agreed to delay it until 2027. This was the third postponement: first from 2022 to 2023, then again to 2025.Related: Crypto’s debanking problem persists despite new regulations The latest delay, reached through bipartisan consensus in late 2024, came amid mounting economic uncertainty and political turmoil. Lawmakers cited fears of investor flight to offshore exchanges, challenges in tracking wallet-based profits, and shifting national priorities in the wake of Yoon’s failed martial law stunt and subsequent impeachment.Jan. 14 — Warning against North Korean crypto hackersThe US, Japan and South Korea published a joint statement on North Korean crypto hacks. Crypto firms were warned to guard against malware and fake IT freelancers. Lazarus Group, the state-sponsored cyber threat group, was named as a prime suspect in some of the top hacks in 2024, such as the $230-million hack on India’s WazirX and the $50-million hack against Upbit, South Korea’s largest crypto exchange.At least $1.34 billion of crypto stolen in 2024 has been attributed to North Korea. Source: ChainalysisJan. 15 — Companies wait on the sidelines for crypto greenlightSouth Korea’s Virtual Asset Committee, a crypto policy coordination body under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), held its second meeting. The FSC was widely expected to approve corporate access to trading accounts on local exchanges. Despite popular demand, the FSC held off on making an official decision, citing the need for further review.Instead, the FSC announced investor protections against price manipulation and stricter stablecoin oversight.Jan. 16 — First enforcement of crypto market manipulationSouth Korean authorities indicted a trader in the first pump-and-dump prosecution under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, the new crypto law effective from July 2024.Meanwhile, Upbit received a suspension notice for allegedly violating Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements in over 500,000 instances, prompting regulators to consider a ban on new user registrations.Jan. 23 — Upbit, Bithumb compensate users after service outages during martial lawUpbit and rival exchange Bithumb announced plans to compensate users following service disruptions triggered by the surprise declaration of nationwide martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. The shocking move caused panic across financial and crypto markets, leading to a surge in traffic that overwhelmed local trading platforms.Ex-President Yoon took his shot at martial law, which backfired and shaped South Korea’s 2025. Source: Kang Min Seok, Presidential Security Service South Korean crypto world finally opened to corporationsFeb. 13 — Charities and universities get first dibs on corporate crypto accessThe FSC unveiled its long-awaited plan to allow corporate entities to open crypto trading accounts in phases by late 2025. The rollout will require businesses to use “real-name” accounts and comply with KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Charities and universities are first in line and will be allowed to sell their crypto donations starting in the first half of the year.South Korea’s real-name financial transaction system, introduced in 1993, was designed to combat tax evasion and money laundering by requiring all bank accounts to be opened under verified legal names using national IDs.Related: Market maker deals are quietly killing crypto projectsCrypto trading exploded in 2017, driven in part by anonymous accounts from businesses, foreigners and minors. Financial authorities responded by requiring crypto exchanges to partner with domestic banks and offer fiat services only through verified real-name accounts. To date, only five exchanges have met the requirements.Since there was no regulatory framework for real-name corporate accounts, this policy effectively shut out both overseas users and domestic companies from trading on South Korean exchanges. The new roadmap aims to fix that by creating a formal structure for institutional participation under tighter compliance standards.Feb. 21 — Alleged serial fraudster busted againPolice rearrested “Jon Bur Kim,” identified by the surname Park, for allegedly profiting 68 billion won (approximately $48 million) in a crypto scam involving the token Artube (ATT). He allegedly employed false advertising, pump-and-dump tactics and wash trading to manipulate the market.This wasn’t Park’s first brush with the law. He was previously indicted in a 14-billion-won (around $10 million) token fraud case and was out on bail when he launched ATT.Park flashes supercars on social media. Source: Jon Bur KimFeb. 25 — Upbit operator Dunamu gets slappedThe nation’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) formally notified Dunamu, operator of Upbit, of regulatory action. The sanctions were tied to KYC compliance failures and dealings with unregistered foreign exchanges. The FIU issued a partial business suspension, restricting Upbit from processing new customers’ deposits and withdrawals for three months.Feb. 27 — Crypto crime force formalizedSouth Korean prosecutors formally launched the Virtual Asset Crime Joint Investigation Division, following a year and seven months as a temporary operation. As a non-permanent unit from July 2023, the task force indicted 74 individuals, secured 25 arrests, and recovered over 700 billion won (around $490 million) in illicit gains. The 30-person task force includes prosecutors, regulatory staff and specialists.Feb. 28 — Upbit operator Dunamu files lawsuit to overturn business sanctionsDunamu said it filed a lawsuit against the FIU to challenge the sanctions imposed on the exchange.Bitcoin ETF next on checklist for South Korean crypto spaceMarch 5 — Reconsidering Bitcoin ETF banThe FSC started reviewing legal pathways to allow Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), citing Japan’s evolving regulatory approach as a potential model. This marks a notable shift from South Korea’s previous opposition to crypto-based ETFs.The Capital Markets Act does not recognize cryptocurrencies as eligible underlying assets for ETFs. However, in 2024, lobbying efforts from major domestic brokerages intensified amid rising client demand, especially after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US.While the review remains in its early stages, regulators are no longer dismissing the possibility outright.March 21 — Crackdown on unregistered exchanges beginsThe FIU compiled a list of illegal foreign exchanges and moved to block access via app stores and ISPs. Additionally, the agency warned of criminal penalties for trading platforms operating without a license.March 26 — 17 exchange apps blocked (including KuCoin and MEXC)Google Play removed 17 unlicensed crypto exchange apps in South Korea at the request of regulators. The FIU said it is also working with Apple to block unauthorized crypto platforms.There are 22 unregistered overseas exchanges on the regulators’ radar, and 17 have been banned from the Google Play store. Source: FSCMarch 27 — Upbit scores three-month breakA South Korean court temporarily lifted the Feb. 25 partial business suspension imposed on crypto exchange Upbit by the FIU. The court’s decision allows Upbit to resume serving new users while the case is under review.South Korean crypto expected to go from crackdown in Q1 to campaign trail in Q2As March ended, more than 16 million investors — roughly a third of South Korea’s population — held crypto accounts, surpassing the 14.1 million domestic stock traders. But that surge in adoption came as trading activity cooled. Upbit, the country’s dominant exchange, saw volumes fall by 34%, dropping from $561.9 billion in Q4 2024 to $371 billion in Q1 2025, according to CoinGecko.By mid-April, the crackdown was still gaining steam. Apple followed Google’s lead in removing offshore exchange apps from its store, while prosecutors filed yet another round of market manipulation charges.South Korea’s crypto industry is now contending with tighter rules, rising institutional expectations and a government no longer content to watch from the sidelines.All this unfolds ahead of an early presidential election in June, following Yoon’s impeachment. Crypto played a visible role in Yoon’s successful 2022 presidential election campaign and is expected to remain a key issue with voters. One candidate in the upcoming election, former prosecutor Hong Joon-pyo of the People Power Party, recently pledged to overhaul crypto regulations in line with the pro-industry stance of the Trump administration, local media reported. Despite the pledge, Hong’s understanding of the technology came into question as he admitted to not knowing what a central bank digital currency is.Magazine: Uni students crypto ‘grooming’ scandal, 67K scammed by fake women: Asia Express',

    summary:
      'Opinion by: Axel Schorn and Dr. Duc AuTraditional stocks, bonds and commodities markets have long benefited from well-established standards governing the flow of information and data. These standards underpin the seamless functioning of trading, settlement and regulatory compliance, ensuring all participants can rely on the same consistent frameworks.As the financial industry moves into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the introduction of digital assets, like crypto assets and tokenized securities, the lack of such standards presents a growing challenge. While digital assets promise transformative potential, their fragmented information landscape risks undermining their adoption and integration into the broader financial ecosystem.Independent platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko provide information on various tokens, but this data varies significantly regarding market capitalization, total supply and other relevant reference data. Several global initiatives by private foundations and associations are working toward standardization. Traditional frameworks as a guideline Just as standardized financial data has been instrumental in building trust and facilitating growth, digital assets need their global standards. According to studies, standards generate overall economic benefits estimated at 17 billion euros annually in Germany alone.For traditional assets, a clear hierarchy of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) exists to unambiguously categorize and identify each asset. The International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is the global standard for uniquely identifying all types of financial instruments, including equities, debt, derivatives and indexes. The Certification of Financial Instruments (CFI) is the internationally recognized system for classifying financial instruments. It is defined when a financial or reference instrument is issued and remains unchanged. The Financial Instrument Short Name (FISN) outlines a standardized approach to short names and descriptions for financial instruments. Unlike ISIN and CFI, the FISN is not intended to be machine-readable but to provide a short format for key information about security for human use. National Numbering Agencies (NNA), responsible for collecting registration data such as issuer information, instrument types, terms and trading conditions, assign ISIN, CFI and FISN. The Association of National Numbering Agencies maintains the identifiers and data in a global database. For countries that do not have an NNA, four global Substitute Numbering Agencies assign identification to those countries.Recent: DePIN needs a more cohesive narrative for mass adoptionISINs are allocated to financial instruments regardless of the technology used for creating the respective instruments, both in paper form and electronic form, thereby including tokenized instruments such as crypto securities according to the German Electronic Securities Act. For tokens with an apparent geographical reference, such as the issuer of a security token residing in Germany, the responsible NNA will allocate the ISIN. Regarding tokens for referential instruments without an apparent geographical reference — e.g., Bitcoin (BTC), where the issuer’s country cannot be identified — an ISIN with the prefix “XT” is allocated from Etrading Software.This helps to identify the instrument on the token level. More exemplary data fields on the token level are the type of token, hash function and generation mechanism. Focused on the instrument level, additional data elements like the token’s blockchain are needed.For this purpose, the Digital Token Identifier Foundation, which is responsible for allocating this new identifier, provides the so-called Digital Token Identifier — e.g. DTI, ISO 24165. Key working theses regarding the standardization of digital assets Crypto identifiers could become mandatory. Similar to traditional assets using systems like ISINs, digital assets will adopt unique identifiers for cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities. These identifiers will facilitate tracking, trading and reporting across exchanges and custody providers, enabling seamless integration with legacy financial systems.Data standards will enhance transparency and compliance: With increasing regulatory scrutiny, standardized data formats will emerge for compliance and risk management. Global coordination will drive interoperability: The standardization of digital assets will rely on global collaboration among regulatory bodies and financial institutions. International organizations will play pivotal roles in creating frameworks that ensure interoperability across jurisdictions and reduce market fragmentation and, thus, inconsistencies in information handling. Initial steps have been taken toward unambiguously identifying digital assets with generally accepted ISO identifiers. Combined with a European Union-wide regulation such as the regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), the industry lays the foundation for more significant adoption. It remains to be seen how investors and the digital assets player will further progress toward more standardization and what roadblocks may arise to be solved.Opinion by: Axel Schorn and Dr. Duc AuThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    summary:
      'Early cypherpunk Adam Back, cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, suggested that quantum computing pressure may reveal whether the blockchain’s pseudonymous creator is alive.During an interview after a Q&A session at the “Satoshi Spritz” event in Turin on April 18, Back suggested that quantum computing may force Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin (BTC). That’s because, according to Back, Bitcoin holders will be forced to move their assets to newer, quantum-resistant signature-based addresses.Back said that current quantum computers do not pose a credible threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography but will likely threaten it in the future. Back estimated that quantum computers may evolve to that extent in “maybe 20 years.”Related: Bitcoin’s quantum-resistant hard fork is inevitable — It’s the only chance to fix node incentivesWhen the threat becomes real, Back said the Bitcoin community will have to choose between deprecating old, vulnerable addresses or letting those funds be stolen:“If the quantum computers are here, and people at universities and research labs have access, the network has a choice to either let people steal them or to freeze them — to deprecate the signature.“Back expects the community to go with the former option, forcing Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator to move their funds if they wish to avoid losing them.Privacy upgrades could complicate proofStill, Back said that whether such a situation will reveal if Satoshi Nakamoto is alive also depends on Bitcoin’s future privacy features.“It depends a bit on the technology, there are some research ideas that could add privacy to Bitcoin,” Back said. “So, possibly there might be a way to fix quantum issues while keeping privacy.“Related: Lawyer sues US Homeland Dept to probe supposed Satoshi Nakamoto meetingStill, not everyone is convinced that — privacy enhancements or not — such a scenario would reveal whether Nakamoto was alive. An anonymous early Bitcoin miner and member of the Bitcoin community told Cointelegraph that he does not expect Nakamoto’s coins to be moved:“Even if he is alive and holds the private keys, I do not think he’d move them. Based on how he acted so far I would rather expect him to let the community to decide.”He added that, since this is a controversial choice, it makes sense to let the community decide. He said that he’d be surprised if Nakamoto came out of the woodwork to move the assets.A quantum-resistant BitcoinBack explained that most quantum-resistant signature implementations are either unproven in terms of security or very expensive from a data perspective. He cited Lamport signatures as an old and proven design, but pointed out that they weigh tens of kilobytes.Consequently, he suggested that Bitcoin should be prepared to switch to quantum-resistant signatures but only do so when necessary. He suggested a Bitcoin taproot-based implementation allowing addresses to switch to quantum-resistant signatures when needed.Magazine: Bitcoin vs. the quantum computer threat: Timeline and solutions (2025–2035)',

      'As gold prices break new highs, many Bitcoiners are seeking ways to get exposure to the precious metal, but have been met with some hurdles along the way.Although physical gold is accessible in the form of jewelry, gold bars and coins, many industry executives are concerned about aspects like its quality, liquidity when selling, and buying at a premium above spot prices.On the other hand, gold advocates are confident that the precious metal is much easier to buy than Bitcoin (BTC), given the complexities of storing private keys and a steep learning curve for new crypto investors.Both Bitcoin and gold are available in the form of tokenized assets, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other equity instruments, but the question of owning these assets in the physical form exposes some differences.Community: Buying Bitcoin is easier and faster“Buying Bitcoin is significantly easier and faster than buying physical gold,” Ross Shemeliak, co-founder of the tokenization platform Stobox, told Cointelegraph.He referred to Bitcoin’s instant and 24/7 availability, no need for vaults, while gold is associated with additional costs like transportation, storage, verification and resale.Adam Lowe, chief of product at the self-custody firm CompoSecure, agreed that buying physical gold is subject to many challenges and additional costs.“The first is maintaining quality, assuring the purity is accurate,” Lowe said, adding that investors have to rely on the reputation of dealers and the supply chain when buying physical gold.Related: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade — Adam Back“Selling liquidity is also an issue as you have to find a buyer and will most likely pay a discount relative to the market price per ounce,” he continued, adding that self-custodied Bitcoin has none of these issues.As well as limited liquidity, retail investors in physical gold face widened spreads, Shemeliak said, as they often have to buy at a premium above the market price of gold.Gold advocate: Bitcoin self-custody is not easyUnlike crypto investors, traditional finance (TradFi) investors and analysts are not so excited about self-custody opportunities offered by Bitcoin.“Bitcoin could be very easy to buy if you have everything set up already, but if you don’t, it’s very difficult,” Rafi Farber, publisher of the gold-focused marketplace service End Game Investor, told Cointelegraph.Farber, who has emerged as one of the biggest Bitcoin critics, referred to challenges for investors around Bitcoin self-custody, which requires holders to safely store the private key or risk losing access to the coins entirely.While dealing with a self-custodial wallet, users have to “remember a string of random words or copy it down and put it in a safe, then copy and paste a gibberish code,” Farber said. “And if you lose any of the codes or the power goes out for whatever reason you’re screwed,” he added.Self-custody wallet providers offer onboarding sessions for $99 per hour. Source: TrezorFarber’s concerns over the challenges of self-custody are not without reason. Trezor, one of the most prominent self-custody wallet providers, admits that usability remains one of the key issues faced by self-custodial wallets.While some have tried to offer simplified self-custody options, others insist that holding a private key is the only way to actually own a cryptocurrency, which requires onboarding and a learning curve — but doesn’t come without its own costs, too.Is Bitcoin a direct competitor to gold?On the other hand, physical gold is “very easy to buy,” Farber said, suggesting options like coins or jewelry shops.“Yes, buying a gold coin at a jewelry or coin shop is easy — but that doesn’t mean you’ve made a sound investment,” Stobox’s Shemeliak countered:“Without verified origin, proper assay, secure storage, and a liquid resale market, you’ve likely bought a souvenir, not a serious store of value.”“In contrast, digital assets like Bitcoin or tokenized gold offer transparency, liquidity and verifiability,” he added.Shemeliak doesn’t see Bitcoin and gold as direct competitors either.“Gold will always have historical value — but Bitcoin is building financial infrastructure for the next 100 years,” he stated.At the time of publication, the price of spot gold stood at $3,327, up nearly 27% year-to-date (YTD) as it continues breaking new highs, according to TradingView.The picture is less appealing for Bitcoin, which reached new highs around $110,000 in December 2024. Bitcoin is down 10% YTD, trading at $84,525 at publication, according to CoinGecko.Magazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over — It’s time to dream big again',

      'Blockchain firm Astar Network implemented changes to its tokenomics to reduce inflationary pressures in its ecosystem. On April 18, Astar Network announced that it reduced the blockchain’s base staking rewards to 10% from 25% to curb token inflation. The company said the change promotes a more stable annual percentage rate (APR) for users as staking inches closer to a more ideal ratio. The firm said this ensures that rewards “remain meaningful” without causing excessive inflation. “This change lowers automatic token issuance, reducing overall inflationary pressure while maintaining strong incentives for users to stake their ASTR,” Astar Network wrote. Astar Network highlights key changes to its tokenomics. Source: Astar NetworkAstar Network implements inflation-control mechanismsUnlike Bitcoin, which has a fixed total supply, the ASTR token operates under a dynamic inflation model without a cap on its maximum token supply. As the blockchain operates, it emits more tokens, increasing the supply. Having no fixed supply can often create downward pressure on the token’s value over time. This is especially true if the demand for the token does not keep up. To address this, Astar is introducing several new inflation-control mechanisms.Apart from lowering staking rewards, Astar also started routing token emissions into a parameter that governs total value locked (TVL)-based rewards like decentralized application staking. This means that DApp staking APRs will become “more predictable” over time, offering stability to stakers. Astar also introduced a new minimum token emission threshold of 2.5% to ensure it doesn’t exceed a sustainable baseline. With continued transaction fee burning, Astar said it would also contribute to reward predictability. According to Astar, the changes have already lowered its annual inflation rate from 4.86% to 4.32%. It also lowered its total ASTR token emitted per block from 153.95 to 136.67 tokens. This reduces the token’s estimated annual emissions by 11%, going from 405 million to 360 million. Related: Sony’s Soneium taps EigenLayer to cut finality to under 10 secondsAstar token hits all-time low on April 7Astar Network’s efforts to curb token inflation come as its native token recently hit an all-time low. CoinGecko data shows that on April 7, the ASTR token declined to a new low of $0.02. The price is 93.8% lower than its peak three years ago, when it reached $0.42 on Jan. 17, 2022. In December 2024, the token rallied along with the rest of the market, hitting a high of $0.09. Since then, the crypto asset had continuously dropped in value before hitting the new all-time low.

      "TL;DRThis guide shows you how to set up and use a crypto hardware wallet, using the Trezor Safe 3 as an example. You’ll learn to safely store Bitcoin, Ethereum and other assets offline, with clear steps for wallet setup, seed phrase backup, PIN protection and secure transaction signing. The article also explains how to connect your hardware wallet to MetaMask for use with DeFi platforms and NFTs – all while keeping your private keys offline. Whether you’re comparing the best hardware wallets in 2025 or need a crypto wallet tutorial for receiving and sending funds, this guide has you covered with actionable tips and best practices for long-term cold storage security.If you’re ready to take crypto wallet security seriously, using a hardware wallet is one of the best steps you can take. You may already be aware of its advantages over a software wallet: keeping your private keys offline, minimizing exposure to malware and giving you full ownership of your crypto assets. Maybe you’ve even picked out your device.The good news? While there are several options out there, from Ledger to Trezor to newer multichain hardware wallets, the basic experience is similar. This hardware wallet setup guide will walk you through unboxing, verifying the device, securing your PIN and backing up your seed phrase.For illustration purposes, this article uses the Trezor Safe 3, an ideal device for beginners but powerful enough for advanced users. It’s also a great choice if you want to use a hardware wallet for DeFi or connect your hardware wallet to MetaMask.Let’s get into it.Unboxing your crypto cold walletBefore you begin setup, here’s what comes with a typical hardware wallet, in this case, the Trezor Safe 3. This applies to most of the best hardware wallets in 2025.What’s in the box:Trezor Safe 3 device with tamper-evident seal.USB-C cable.Two recovery seed cards (for your wallet backup).Quick start guide.Trezor stickers.First steps: Inspect and verifyBefore plugging anything in, check for:Sealed, undamaged packaging.Intact holographic sticker over the USB port.This ensures your device hasn’t been tampered with, a crucial crypto wallet security tip. Newer devices (post-April 2024) have upgraded seals for added air-gapped security.If anything looks suspicious, contact Trezor support.Power it upPeel the sticker and connect via USB — the Safe 3 powers on automatically, and no battery or power button is needed.You’ll notice a small screen and two physical buttons. These are how you’ll confirm actions, approve transactions and manage your crypto.Let’s begin the setup.Hardware wallet setup: Trezor Safe 3Getting started takes about 10–15 minutes. For this crypto hardware wallet tutorial, just have your computer ready and a pen handy. You’ll soon need to write down something very important.Step 1: Download Trezor SuiteGo to the official Trezor site and download the Trezor Suite app. It’s available on Windows, macOS, Linux and via web browser.Open it, plug in your device and follow the prompts. Click “Set up my Trezor.”Step 2: Install firmwareYour device may not come with firmware pre-installed. Click “Install Firmware.” This is part of the crypto wallet recovery process and ensures a secure, clean slate.Step 3: Verify device authenticityClick “Let’s check your device” in Trezor Suite. Press the right button on your Safe 3 to authenticate. You’ll see a message confirming the device is verified.Step 4: Quick tutorialThe device might walk you through button usage. Just follow along, it’s a one-time setup.Step 5: Create a new walletYou’ll see two options:Create new wallet (choose this if it’s your first time).Recover wallet (for restoring, using your seed phrase).Step 6: Backup methodYou’ll choose between:Standard seed backup (easiest and most common).Shamir backup (advanced; splits the seed into parts).Stick with standard, unless you’re sure you know what you're doing.Step 7: Confirm on deviceUse the buttons to confirm your backup method and agree to terms. Press “Create wallet” to proceed.Step 8: Write down your recovery seedThis is the heart of your cold storage for crypto. The device will generate a random list of 12, 20 or 24 words, your recovery seed.Trezor will remind you not to take photos or digital notes of the seed. Write it down on the provided card and store your crypto seed phrase safely. This is critical for future recovery.Step 9: Confirm the seedYou’ll be tested on a few of the words (e.g., “What’s word #5?”). Select the correct ones using the buttons. Once confirmed, your backup is complete.Pro tip: Make a second copy of your seed and store it in a different secure location. This adds an extra layer of protection.Step 10: Set up a PINNow, create your hardware wallet PIN. In Trezor Suite, click “Set PIN.” The device will prompt you with a randomized layout. Use the buttons to choose your digits.PINs can be up to 50 digits long. Choose something memorable, but not obvious. If forgotten, you'll need to wipe the wallet and recover with the seed phrase.Step 11: Enable coins and final setupYou’ll now choose which coins to enable, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and more. This step also prepares your wallet for use with DApps or storing Bitcoin in a hardware wallet.After clicking “Complete Setup,” you can name your device or customize the home screen. Then hit “Access Suite” to open your dashboard.If you’ve been following along on your own device, you’ve just completed your first hardware wallet setup and taken a major step toward storing crypto safely!Receiving crypto with a hardware walletOnce your device is set up, you’re ready to store crypto safely by receiving funds into your wallet. Here’s how to accept crypto securely with your Trezor hardware wallet.1. Open the correct accountIn Trezor Suite, choose the account for the crypto you want to receive (e.g., Bitcoin #1 or Ether #1). Click the “Receive” tab to generate a crypto cold wallet address.2. Show and confirm the addressClick “Show full address” in the app. Your Trezor will display the full address on its screen. Always confirm the address on the hardware wallet itself, not just in your browser. This ensures it hasn’t been altered by malware on your computer (a standard crypto wallet security tip).3. Use the addressCopy the address or scan the QR code to send crypto. Your Trezor doesn’t need to stay connected; the blockchain will receive the funds and update your balance next time you plug the wallet in.Pro tips for safe receiving:Confirm addresses on your device, not just your screen.Use a fresh address each time for added privacy (Trezor Suite supports this).If the address doesn’t match between your wallet and app, stop immediately.Sending crypto from a hardware walletSending crypto with a hardware wallet means your private key stays offline, even while broadcasting a transaction. Here’s how to do it securely:1. Select the correct accountIn the Trezor Suite, go to the account holding the asset you want to send. Click “Send.”2. Fill in transaction detailsEnter the recipient’s wallet address and the amount to send. You can also toggle to fiat view if needed. Double-check the recipient address to avoid mistakes.3. Choose a FeeFor Bitcoin, you can select from fee levels: Low, Standard or High.For Ether or ERC-20 tokens, Trezor Suite estimates gas fees automatically.4. Confirm on the deviceClick “Review & Send.” Your Trezor will display the transaction details:Destination address.Amount.Network fee.Only approve the transaction if everything checks out. This is how you protect yourself from clipboard malware.5. Done, signed transaction is now sent!Your signed transaction has now been sent, with zero exposure of your private key. You’ll see the confirmation in your history.More pro tips:If your Trezor asks to sign a transaction you didn’t initiate, cancel immediately.Make sure your ETH balance is sufficient to cover gas for token transfers.For advanced users: Trezor also supports air-gapped security setups using microSD backups.Using a hardware wallet with MetaMask and DAppsWant to use your hardware wallet for DeFi or NFTs while keeping your keys secure? Trezor Safe 3 integrates seamlessly with MetaMask, making it easy to use DApps and sign transactions safely.1. Connect Trezor to MetaMaskOpen MetaMask in your browser. Click your account icon and choose “Connect Hardware Wallet.” Select Trezor when prompted.2. Plug in your TrezorIf not already connected, plug in the device. MetaMask may prompt you to install Trezor Bridge, a utility that enables communication with the wallet.You’ll be asked to approve the reading of your public key from the hardware wallet. This is safe and doesn’t reveal private keys.3. Select a wallet addressMetaMask will list your Trezor-linked Ethereum addresses. Choose one (e.g., Ethereum #1) and click “Unlock.” The wallet will now appear in MetaMask, marked as a hardware wallet.How it worksFrom now on, every time you make a transaction, whether it’s swapping tokens on Uniswap or minting an NFT, you will:Initiate the transaction in MetaMask.See the details appear on your Trezor screen.Physically confirm the transaction using your device buttons.This flow ensures that even if your browser is compromised, the final transaction approval happens on your trusted hardware wallet.Final safety tip: Your hardware wallet screen is the most trustworthy place to verify transaction details. Never rely solely on what you see in the browser.Why hardware wallets matter in 2025Whether you're storing Bitcoin, using DeFi protocols or exploring NFTs, hardware wallets remain the gold standard for crypto security. With cold storage for crypto, recovery tools like seed phrases and integration with platforms like MetaMask offer powerful protection with ease of use.If the Trezor Safe 3 feels like a good fit, it’s available at a discount via the provided link, a smart first step into secure, self-custodied crypto.Still weighing your options?

      'Altcoins may see a resurgence in the second quarter of 2025 as regulations for digital assets continue to improve, according to Swiss bank Sygnum.In its Q2 2025 investment outlook, Sygnum said the space has seen “drastically improved” regulations for crypto use cases, creating the foundations for a strong alt-sector rally for the second quarter. However, it added that “none of the positive developments have been priced in.” In April, Bitcoin dominance reached a four-year high, signaling that crypto investors are rotating their funds into an asset perceived to be relatively safer. Still, Sygnum said regulatory developments in the US, such as President Donald Trump’s establishment of a Digital Asset Stockpile and advancing stablecoin regulations, may propel broader crypto adoption.“We expect protocols successful in gaining user traction to outperform and Bitcoin’s dominance to decline,” Sygnum wrote. Increased focus on economic value ignites competitionSygnum also said that competition would increase as the market focuses on economic value. Increased competition in a market often results in better products, ultimately benefiting consumers: “The market’s increased focus on economic value compels greater competition for user growth and revenues, with rising protocols such as Toncoin, Sui, Aptos, Sonic, or Berachain taking different approaches.”Sygnum added that while high-performance blockchains address limitations of the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana blockchains, they find it challenging to achieve meaningful adoption and fee income. Sector breakdown by market capitalization. Source: SygnumThe report highlighted that some approaches have been more sustainable. These include Berachain’s approach of incentivizing validators to provide liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Sonic’s rewarding developers that attract and retain users, and Toncoin’s Telegram affiliation to access 1 billion users.Aside from layer-1 chains, Sygnum highlighted that layer-2 networks like Base also have potential. The report pointed out that while the memecoin frenzy on the blockchain pushed its users and revenue to new highs, it made an equally sharp decline after memecoins started losing steam. Despite this, Sygnum noted that Base remains the layer-2 leader in metrics like daily transactions, throughput and total value locked.

    summary:
      'Bitcoinlib, explained              Bitcoinlib is an open-source Python library designed to make Bitcoin development easier. Think of it as a toolbox for programmers who want to create Bitcoin wallets, manage transactions, or build apps that interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. Since its launch, it’s been downloaded over 1 million times, showing just how widely trusted and used it is in the crypto community.Here’s what Bitcoinlib does in a nutshell:Creates and manages wallets: It lets developers build Bitcoin wallets to store, send and receive Bitcoin securely.Handles transactions: It simplifies the process of creating, signing and broadcasting Bitcoin transactions.Supports multiple networks: Bitcoinlib works with Bitcoin’s main network (where real money is involved) and test networks (for experimenting without risk).Open-source and flexible: Being open-source, anyone can use, modify or contribute to its code, making it a go-to for developers worldwide.For beginners, Bitcoinlib is like a user-friendly bridge to Bitcoin’s complex world. Instead of wrestling with the blockchain’s technical details, developers can use Bitcoinlib’s ready-made functions to get things done quickly. For example, this library automates tricky tasks like generating private keys or signing transactions, saving developers hours of coding.                  Bitcoinlib under fire: How PyPI typosquatting put crypto wallets at risk              In early April 2025, security researchers raised alarms about a malicious attack targeting Bitcoinlib users. Hackers didn’t attack the Bitcoinlib library itself but instead used a sneaky trick to fool developers into downloading fake versions of the library. This attack involved uploading malicious packages to PyPI, the platform where developers download Python libraries like Bitcoinlib. For developers and enthusiasts, tools like Bitcoinlib make it easier to interact with Bitcoin’s blockchain, create wallets, and build applications. But with great power comes great responsibility — and unfortunately, great risk. The 2025 Software Supply Chain Security Report by ReversingLabs reveals that software supply chain attacks grew more sophisticated in 2024, with particular intensity around cryptocurrency applications. The report highlights 23 malicious campaigns targeting crypto infrastructure, primarily through open-source repositories like npm and PyPI (Python Package Index). Attackers employed both basic typosquatting and advanced tactics, such as creating legitimate-looking packages that were later updated with malicious code. Examples include the “aiocpa” package, which initially appeared benign but was later weaponized to compromise wallets, and the attack on Solana’s web3.js library.ReversingLabs calls cryptocurrency a “canary in the coal mine,” noting that the financial incentives make crypto platforms an attractive target — and a preview of future threats to other industries. The report urges organizations to move beyond trust-based assumptions, especially when dealing with third-party or closed-source binaries.Let’s break down how it happened and why it’s a big deal.How hackers targeted BitcoinlibHere’s a step-by-step look at the attack:Fake packages uploaded to PyPI: Hackers created two fake Python packages called “bitcoinlibdbfix” and “bitcoinlib-dev.” These names were deliberately chosen to sound legitimate, tricking developers into thinking they were updates or fixes for the real Bitcoinlib.Masquerading as solutions: The fake packages were marketed as solutions to a supposed issue with Bitcoinlib that caused error messages during Bitcoin transfers. Developers, eager to fix their code, downloaded these packages without suspecting foul play.Malware embedded in the code: Once installed, the fake packages unleashed wallet-draining malware. This malware replaced a legitimate command-line tool (called clw) with a malicious version. The fake tool was designed to steal sensitive data, such as private keys and wallet addresses, which are the keys to accessing and moving Bitcoin.Stealing crypto assets: With private keys in hand, hackers could access victims’ Bitcoin wallets and transfer funds to their own accounts. Since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, victims had little chance of recovering their money.Thankfully, security researchers used machine learning to spot the malware. By analyzing patterns in the fake packages, they identified the threat and warned the community, helping to limit the damage.Why does this attack matter?This hack wasn’t about breaking Bitcoin’s blockchain (which remains secure) but about exploiting human trust. Developers who downloaded the fake packages thought they were getting the real library and ended up with malware that could wipe out their Bitcoin (BTC) savings. It’s a reminder that even trusted platforms like PyPI can be used for scams if you’re not careful.                  How typosquatting made the Bitcoinlib attack so effective              The Bitcoinlib attack worked because of a tactic called typosquatting. This is when hackers create fake package names that look almost identical to the real ones (like “bitcoinlibdbfix” instead of “bitcoinlib”). Developers, especially those in a rush, might not notice the difference. Here’s why this trick was so effective:Trust in PyPI: PyPI is the go-to place for Python libraries, so developers assume packages there are safe.Clever naming: The fake packages sounded like official updates, making them seem legitimate.Targeting beginners: New developers, less familiar with spotting scams, were more likely to fall for it.The attack also highlights a broader issue: Open-source platforms rely on community oversight, but they can’t catch every bad actor. Hackers know this and use it to their advantage.                  New to crypto? Here’s what the Bitcoinlib incident teaches about staying safe              If you’re new to crypto, the Bitcoinlib hack might sound scary, but it’s not a reason to avoid Bitcoin or development tools. Instead, it’s a chance to learn how to stay safe in a space that’s full of opportunities — and risks. Bitcoinlib is still one of the ways to dip your toes into blockchain development, as long as you take precautions.Here’s why this matters for you (as a beginner):Crypto is growing: With Bitcoin’s value soaring and governments exploring digital currencies, learning tools like Bitcoinlib can open doors to exciting careers.Security is key: Understanding scams now will make you a smarter, safer crypto user in the future.Community power: The crypto world thrives on collaboration. By staying informed, you can help protect others from scams.Bitcoinlib is a game-changer for developers who want to explore Bitcoin’s potential. It’s easy to use, powerful and backed by a vibrant community. But as the Bitcoinlib attack showed, even the best tools can be targeted by hackers if you’re not careful. By sticking to trusted sources, double-checking package names and keeping security first, you can use Bitcoinlib to build amazing things without worry.The crypto world is full of surprises — some good, others not so good. The Bitcoinlib hack reminds one to stay curious but cautious. Whether you’re coding your first wallet or just learning about Bitcoin, take it one step at a time, and you’ll be ready to navigate this exciting space like a pro.Have you used Bitcoinlib before, or are you thinking about trying it?During your engagement with Bitcoinlib, if you come across anything suspicious, don’t stay silent — spread the word. In a decentralized world, community awareness is one of the strongest defenses.                  How to protect yourself from similar crypto hacks              If you’re a developer or crypto user worried about falling for scams like this, don’t panic. Here are some beginner-friendly tips to stay safe:Double-check package names: Always verify the exact name of the package you’re downloading. For Bitcoinlib, stick to the official package (just “bitcoinlib”) and avoid anything with extra words like “fix” or “dev.”Use trusted sources: Download libraries only from reputable platforms like PyPI’s official site, and check user reviews or download counts to gauge trustworthiness.Keep software updated: Regularly update your Python environment and libraries to avoid bugs that hackers could exploit.Use antivirus software: A good antivirus can catch malware before it causes harm, even if you accidentally download a bad package.Store private keys safely: Never store private keys on your computer or in code. Use a hardware wallet (like a Ledger or Trezor) for extra security.Learn to spot scams: If a package claims to fix an urgent issue or seems too good to be true, take a moment to research it. Google the package name or check crypto forums for warnings.Above all, the lesson is clear for Bitcoinlib users: Stick to the official package and verify everything. For the broader crypto world, this attack underscores the need for better security on open-source platforms.',

      'The Synthetix protocol’s native stablecoin, Synthetix USD (SUSD), has slipped further away from its US dollar peg, reaching new all-time lows under $0.70. However, the firm reiterates that this isn’t the first time the asset has been under significant stress, and several risk measures are in place.“Synthetix and sUSD have weathered multiple bear markets and periods of stablecoin volatility; this is not the first resilience test,” a spokesperson from Synthetix told Cointelegraph.SUSD down almost 31% from its intended 1:1 pegsUSD is a crypto-collateralized stablecoin. Users lock up SNX tokens to mint sUSD, making its stability highly dependent on the market value of Synthetix (SNX). At the time of publication, sUSD (SUSD) is trading at $0.70, 30% below its intended 1:1 peg with the US dollar, according to CoinMarketCap data.sUSD reached as low as $0.66 before rebounding to $0.70 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCapDuring the same period, SNX has held relatively steady, dipping just 1.08% over the past week, trading at $0.63. However, from a broader view of the overall crypto market downturn, SNX has fallen approximately 26% over the past 30 days.The spokesperson explained that sUSD’s short-term volatility is driven by “structural shifts” after the SIP-420 launch, a proposal that shifts debt risk from stakers to the protocol itself. They explained that the firm has short, medium, and long-term plans to mitigate the risks.In the short term, Synthetix said it will continue supporting liquidity for sUSD through Curve pools and deposit campaigns on its derivatives platform, Infinex.For mid-term measures, Synthetix has introduced “simple debt-free” SNX staking that it says will “encourage individual debt repayment.”Over the long term, the firm says it will make capital efficiency changes through the 420 Pool, take over protocol-level management of sUSD supply, and introduce new “adoption-focused mechanisms” across Synthetix products.Related: Crypto in a bear market, rebound likely in Q3 — CoinbaseSynthetix founder Kain Warwick explained on April 2 that the volatility is largely due to the primary driver of sUSD buying having been removed. “New mechanisms are being introduced, but in this transition, there will be some volatility,” Warwick said in an X post.“It is worth pointing out that sUSD is not an algo stable, it is a pure crypto collateralized stable, the peg can and does drift, but there are mechanisms to push it back in line if it goes above or below the peg,” he added.On April 10, Cointelegraph reported that the asset has faced persistent instability since the start of 2025.

      'There has been a 66% year-on-year decrease in the number of crypto rug pulls this year compared to 2024, but recent data shows the size of each rug pull has been increasing. Rug pulls have dropped in frequency year-over-year, with early 2024 recording 21 separate incidents, compared to only seven so far in 2025, according to an April 16 report from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.However, since the beginning of 2025, the Web3 ecosystem has lost nearly $6 billion to rug pulls, according to DappRadar’s report. However, the report attributes 92% of that to Mantra’s OM token collapse, which the founders have strongly denied was a rug pull.In comparison, during the same period in early 2024, three months into the year, total losses from rug pulls hit $90 million.“This shift suggests that rug pulls are becoming less frequent, but far more devastating when they do occur,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. “The scams are increasingly sophisticated, often orchestrated by teams with polished branding and well-planned narratives.”Memecoins main culprit for rug pulls Gherghelas says the nature of rug pulls is evolving. In the first quarter of 2024, most originated in DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and memecoins. In the same time frame for 2025, most rug pulls occurred in memecoins.Libertad project’s native Solana token, Libra (LIBRA), is one of the more recent high-profile cases of a rug pull; it rallied to a market capitalization of $4.56 billion on Feb. 14 after Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, posted about it on X.The token then fell by over 94% after he deleted the post, prompting accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. “Rug pulls and exit scams remain a persistent threat, especially in ecosystems where projects can rapidly gain traction through hype, only to disappear with user funds overnight,” Gherghelas said.“Despite increasing awareness and more tools to detect suspicious behavior, rug pulls remain a recurring issue, particularly in DeFi and newly launched token ecosystems.”Gherghelas says red flags for rug pulls can include a sudden spike in unique active wallets without an apparent reason or unusually high volume paired with low user activity.DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas says several red flags could signal a project is a rug pull. Source: DappRadarAt the same time, projects with unverified smart contracts, limited GitHub activity, or anonymous developer teams or DApps that spike overnight can also be a red flag.Related: Savvy memecoin trader makes $988K in 3 hours despite rug pull“As the industry matures, so do the tactics used by bad actors.

    summary:
      'American film producer, record executive and art collector David Geffen has hit back at crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun in a countersuit disputing ownership claims over a multimillion-dollar sculpture.The billionaire American media mogul filed a counterclaim against Sun on April 16, calling the Tron founder’s suit a “sham” and adding claims of “unethical and/or illegal business activities.”Sun sued Geffen in February, claiming that the statue was stolen from him by a former employee who then sold the artwork to Geffen in a deal worth around $65 million in artwork and cash.Sun purchased the Alberto Giacometti sculpture titled “Le Nez” at a Sotheby’s auction in 2021 for $78 million, working with the assistance of his former art adviser, Xiong Zihan Sydney.In the 100-page countersuit, Geffen claims that Sun and Xiong “contrived this fraudulent lawsuit” after they couldn’t profitably sell two paintings that Geffen had exchanged for the sculpture, along with $10.5 million in cash.“Sun’s claims concerning Le Nez, a sculpture by the artist Alberto Giacometti, are utterly without merit and constitute a bad-faith, tortious attempt to interfere with Geffen’s ownership of Le Nez,” the counterclaim read. Geffen also claims that Sun was eager to sell the sculpture because crypto markets were crashing throughout 2022 and 2023 and his crypto platforms Poloniex and HTX were repeatedly hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars in 2023.  Alberto Giacometti’s Le Nez. Source: Fondation GiacomettKey disputes include whether Xiong confessed to stealing the sculpture, inconsistencies in Sun’s claims about how much money Xiong allegedly stole, and Geffen’s claim that Sun still has the money and the paintings, which are being held by art dealers.Fraudulent behavior allegations Geffen takes things further by alleging Sun has a history of fraudulent behavior, such as being sued by former employees for punishing them for refusing to engage in “unethical and/or illegal business activities,” and making false statements in other lawsuits. Related: Justin Sun ‘not aware’ of circulating reports about CZ plea dealOn April 17, Sun’s lawyer, William Charron, refuted essential aspects of Geffen’s countersuit, according to ArtNet. Ms. Xiong confessed to her theft, was arrested in China, and is in detention in China today, he said before adding: “In spite of these facts, Mr. Geffen goes all-in on the idea that Ms. Xiong was not a thief; that she supposedly spoke for Mr. Sun at all times; and that she is walking freely in China today. Mr. Geffen’s pleading is extremely misguided,” he stated before adding, “We eagerly look forward to litigating this case and to recovering Mr. Sun’s property.” In November, Sun bought Maurizio Cattelan’s Comedian — a banana taped to the wall — at Sotheby’s New York for $6.2 million, and then ate the banana at a press conference in a publicity stunt.

    summary:
      'Yemeni citizens are increasingly using decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to bank themselves amid US sanctions aimed at the Houthi group, which they have deemed a terrorist organization. In the past, internet infrastructure challenges and low financial literacy among the war-torn population contributed to relatively limited crypto adoption, according to an April 17 report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs.“However, there are signs of growing interest and usage driven primarily by necessity rather than speculation,” the blockchain intelligence firm said. “For those who use cryptocurrencies in Yemen, the ability to bypass the disruption in local financial services offers a modicum of financial resilience, especially as banks can be difficult to access or are simply inoperable due to the ongoing conflict.” Yemen has been in a civil war between the government and the Houthi group since September 2014. The US has also frequently sanctioned financial infrastructure in the country to disrupt Houthi activity, with the most recent action on April 17 hitting the International Bank of Yemen.DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen’s crypto-related web traffic, taking up over 63% of observed activity, while global centralized exchanges account for 18% of crypto-related web traffic, TRM Labs data shows.DeFi platforms account for most of Yemen’s crypto-related web traffic, followed by centralized exchanges. Source: TRM LabsSome local Yemenis also use peer-to-peer crypto transactions to move funds across borders or conduct remittances.“Although these interactions do not necessarily imply high transaction volumes, they reinforce that for some individuals in Yemen, decentralized infrastructure may provide a necessary alternative to traditional payment rails,” TRM Labs said.“The interest in DeFi services may reflect the appeal of systems that allow users to transact without intermediaries, particularly where local banking institutions are inaccessible or unreliable.” Increasing sanctions could spark higher crypto adoption in Yemen Currently, Yemen doesn’t have legislation in place for the use of crypto; TRM Labs speculates that increasing sanctions against the Houthis could be the spark that ignites higher crypto adoption in Yemen.Following the Biden administration’s relisting of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in January 2024, a Yemen-based cryptocurrency exchange tracked by TRM experienced a 270% increase in overall volume, the blockchain intelligence firm said. Related: US DOJ says it seized Hamas crypto meant to finance terrorismIt eventually returned to pre-spike levels, but it saw another uptick again, this time by 223%, in the three months following the election of US President Donald Trump and the reinstating of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization by the US on Jan. 22. “Given the intensifying international sanctions on the Houthis and their primary backer, Iran, the group’s use of cryptocurrency is likely to grow in both scale and sophistication,” TRM Labs said. “As traditional financial avenues become increasingly restricted, decentralized digital currencies offer an alternative that is less susceptible to oversight and harder to trace.” Magazine: Terrorism and the Israel-Gaza war have been weaponized to destroy crypto',

    summary:
      'Crypto research firm Galaxy Research has made a proposal to adjust the voting system that decides the outcome of future Solana inflation following the failure to come to a consensus in a previous vote.On April 17, Galaxy introduced a Solana proposal called “Multiple Election Stake-Weight Aggregation” (MESA) to reduce the inflation rate of its native token, SOL (SOL). The researchers described the proposal as a “more market-based approach to agreeing on the rate of future SOL emissions.”Rather than using traditional yes/no voting for inflation rates, MESA allows validators to vote on multiple deflation rates and uses the weighted average as the outcome.“Instead of cycling through inflation reduction proposals until one passes, what if validators could allocate their votes to one or many changes, with the aggregate of ‘yes’ outcomes becoming the adopted emissions curve?” Galaxy explained.  The motivation for the concept comes from a previous proposal (SIMD-228), which showed community agreement that SOL inflation should be reduced, but the binary voting system couldn’t find consensus on specific parameters. SIMD-228 proposed to change Solana’s inflation system from a fixed schedule to a dynamic, market-based model. The new proposal suggests maintaining the fixed, terminal inflation rate at 1.5% and sets forth multiple outcomes that create multiple ‘yes’ voting options with different deflation rates from which an average is aggregated if a quorum is reached. For example, if 5% vote for no change, remaining at 15% deflation, 50% vote for a 30% deflation rate, and 45% vote for 33%, the new deflation rate would be calculated as the aggregate at 30.6%. The target is to reach the terminal rate of 1.5% supply inflation. Predicted inflation curves under new voting proposal. Source: Galaxy Digital Solving problems with binary voting The benefits are that a more market-driven system allows validators to express preferences along a spectrum rather than with binary choices, while maintaining predictability with a fixed inflation curve.“Galaxy Research seeks to suggest a genuinely alternative process to achieving what we believe is the community’s broad goal, and not necessarily proscribe any particular inflation rate outcome,” the firm explained. Related: Solana upgrades will strengthen network but squeeze validators — VanEckUnder the current mechanism, supply inflation begins at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% per year until it reaches 1.5%.

    summary:
      "Slovenia’s Finance Ministry is considering a possible 25% tax on crypto trading profits for residents in the country under a new draft law now open for public consultation. The bill proposes to tax traders when they sell their cryptocurrency for fiat or pay for goods and services, but crypto-to-crypto and transfers between wallets owned by the same user will be exempt, Slovenia’s Finance Ministry said in an April 17 statement.Under the proposed legislation, crypto tax will be aligned with existing tax laws. Slovenia taxpayers will be required to keep a record of all their transactions for annual tax returns. The tax base would be calculated on profits by subtracting the purchase price from the sale price. In a statement to the Slovenia Times, finance minister Klemen Boštjančič said it’s unreasonable that crypto trading for individuals isn’t currently taxed in the country. “The goal of taxation of crypto assets is not to generate tax revenue, but we find it illogical and unreasonable that one of the most speculative financial instruments is not taxed at all,” he said in a statement translated from Slovenian. New tax could stifle crypto in Slovenia, lawmaker says Jernej Vrtovec, a member of Slovenia’s national assembly and New Slovenia opposition party, slammed the proposal in an April 16 statement to X, arguing it could stifle crypto growth in the country. “Slovenia has the opportunity to become a crypto-friendly country, but with the government’s proposals, we will miss the train again,” he said in a post also translated from Slovenian. “With excessive taxation, we will once again see young people and capital fleeing abroad. Taxes should encourage, not stifle.” Source: Jernej VrtovecThe proposal is open to public consultation until May 5. If Slovenian lawmakers pass the bill, it will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026. Slovenia introduced a 10% tax on crypto withdrawals and payments in 2023, but capital gains from occasional crypto trading are not taxed, according to the crypto tax platform Token Tax.

A previous bill proposed in April 2022 planned to levy a 5% tax on profits over 10,000 euros ($11,372), but it was never passed into law. Slovenia issued the first digital sovereign bond in the European Union on July 25 last year. It had a nominal size of 30 million euros ($32.5 million) with a 3.65% coupon and a maturity date of Nov. 25 that year. The number of crypto users in Slovenia is projected to reach roughly 98,000 in 2025, according to online data platform Statisa, with a penetration rate of 4.6% among its population of 2.12 million people. While the projected revenue for the country's crypto market is slated to hit $2.8 million. Magazine: How crypto laws are changing across the world in 2025",

      "Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized market cap reached a new all-time high of $872 billion, but data from Glassnode reflects investors’ lack of enthusiasm at BTC’s current price levels. In a recent X post, the analytics platform pointed out that despite the realized cap milestone, the monthly growth rate of the metric has dropped to 0.9% month over month, which implied a risk-off sentiment in the market. Bitcoin realized cap net position. Source: X.comRealized cap measures the total value of all Bitcoin at the price they last moved, reflecting the actual capital invested, providing insight into Bitcoin’s economic activity. A slowing growth rate highlights a positive but reduced capital inflow, suggesting fewer new investors or less activity from current holders.Additionally, Glassnode’s realized profit and loss chart recently exhibited a sharp decline of 40%, which signals high profit-taking or loss realization. The data platform explained,“This suggests saturation in investor activity and often precedes a consolidation phase as the market searches for a new equilibrium.”While new investors remained sidelined, existing investors are probably adopting a cautious approach due to the short-term holder’s realized price. Data from CryptoQuant suggested that the current short-term realized price is $91,600.
